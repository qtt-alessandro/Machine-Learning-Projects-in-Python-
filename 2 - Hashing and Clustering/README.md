In this homework we have implemented two important algorithms from scratch: the first is HyperLogLog and the second is K-Mean. 
Since these two algorithms required several functions and a few lines of code, we decided to organise the project in the following way.  
The final notebook contains only the results of the functions, some theoretical sections and explanations of the code.   
This allow you to focus on the analysis of the results and the organisation.  
There are also four ***.py*** files containing the code used to implement the algorithms and functions required.   
In particular: 

* ```hash_function.py``` contains the hash function used to implement the HLL. 
* ```HLL contains``` the HyperLog algorithm.
* ```global_cleaning``` contains all the functions required for cleaning text such as punctuation, stop words, stemming, some verbs and adverbs. 
* ```K_Mean``` contains the algorithm for clustering.
